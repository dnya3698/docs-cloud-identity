Phone PIN
=========
When a customer calls into Rackspace, they will be required to give a 6 digit
phone PIN to the IVR or Support Racker to verify their identity. When a new user
is created, a 6 digit numeric phone PIN is assigned to the user by default. The
phone PIN cannot be deleted, however a user can update his phone PIN
using ``Update user information and password`` API.
